    "**Author:** Meg Hutch\n",

    "**Date:** February 14, 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Use neural networks to classify cancer type. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In this version, I will only test the ability of methylation levels to classify cancer types. I will not include phenotypic data for now. Additionally, this version has our data split 70% for training and 30% for testing. The 70% training data will undergo leave-one-out-cross-fold validation to tune hyperparameters prior to testing final performance on the 30% test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This is the new version of the script where we normalize gene counts using DEseq2 in the initial pre-processing script in R. This provided more than double the number of Principal Components that make up 90% of the variance (157). Regardless, we will begin running the deep learning classifier on the revised data. "
