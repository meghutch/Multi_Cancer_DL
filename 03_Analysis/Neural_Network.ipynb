    "**Updates Feb 2:** I have the code working in a way that runs...but I need to ensure that the code is running in the way that I want. For each training set (Training set - 1), we want to run the neural network and then test the prediction of the 1 sample left out. Then we want to aggregate the predictions (test error) in order to average and have a sense of model performance. As of now, when I increase the number of samples + epochs we are getting no testing errors which seems highly unlikely and makes me thinkt there is a problem with my for loop.\n",
